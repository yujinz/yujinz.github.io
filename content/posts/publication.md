S.W. Lee, **Y. Zhang**, I. Wong, Y. Yang, S.D. O'Keefe, W.S. Lasecki. [SketchExpress: Remixing Animations for More Effective Crowd-Powered Prototyping of Interactive Interfaces](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/pubs/SketchExpress_UIST2017.pdf)

<!--more-->
In Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST 2017). Quebec City, Canada.

SketchExpress is built upon [Apparition](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/projects-proto.html), a crowdsourced UI prototyping web application. As described in the title of the paper, it enables recording and remixing animations on a online canvas to prototype interactive interfaces. 

I contributed to the project by:

* Collaborated on the animation plugin for demonstrating interactive UI

* Proposed and developed a communication plugin with chat box and real-time synchronization, increasing rate of finishing
the experiments by three times
