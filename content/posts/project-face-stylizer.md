A face stylizer that puts an artistic mask generated from a portrait painting on the face in a photo. It detects facial keypoints, warps the painting onto the photo according to the keypoints, and blends them with different weights on different areas.

Inspired by [this paper at SIGGRAPH 2017](http://dcgi.fel.cvut.cz/home/sykorad/facestyle.html). Simplified the input from stream videos to static photos.

Collaborated with [Yukang Shen](https://github.com/JohnsonSYK) as the final project of [CS 543 Computer Vision](http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/spring18/) at UIUC.
