My name is Yujin Zhang (pronounced You-jean Jaang). I'm a backend software engineer in San Francisco. I graduated from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (M.S. in CS), University of Michigan Ann Arbor (B.S. in CS), and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (B.S. in ECE).
I enjoy going to parks, commuting by bike and Caltrain, organizing spaces, reading fictions, and playing Nintendo Switch.
