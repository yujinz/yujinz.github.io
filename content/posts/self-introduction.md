My name is Yujin Zhang (pronounced You-jean Jaang). I'm a backend software engineer in San Francisco. I went to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Michigan Ann Arbor, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

<br>

I like going to parks, biking to work, organizing spaces, reading fictions, and playing [Ring Fit Adventure](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/ring-fit-adventure-switch/).
