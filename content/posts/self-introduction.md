My name is Yujin Zhang (pronounced You-jean Jaang). I'm a backend software engineer in San Francisco. I graduated from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (M.S.), University of Michigan Ann Arbor (B.S.), and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (B.S.).
I enjoy going to parks, biking to work, organizing spaces, reading fictions, and playing [Ring Fit Adventure](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/ring-fit-adventure-switch/).
