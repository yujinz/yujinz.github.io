I was born in Beijing and studied Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Michigan Ann Arbor, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I'm currently working as a [backend software engineer](/resume_github.pdf) in San Francisco.


I enjoy going to parks, commuting by bike and Caltrain, organizing spaces, reading fictions, watching animations, and playing Nintendo Switch. I also enjoyed boxing and rock climbing when I lived in the city. Since 2020, I developed an interest in Social Work and started learning courses during my spare time at a very slow pace. I speak Mandarin, English, and a little bit of Japanese and American Sign Language.
