The hero can use hammer to attack enemies and use propeller to climb up platforms. Hammer is the default weapon and is controlled by rotating joystick for less than 180 degree. It can be switched to a propeller when rotating the joystick for over 180 degree. What's unique about this gameplay experience is that all actions are controlled by joysticks and there's no button pressing involved.
