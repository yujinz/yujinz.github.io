      <description>&lt;p&gt;A 3D platform game where the hero climbs a four-sided tower while dogding and attacking enemies. His weapon can switch between a hammer and a propeller, helping him attack as well as jump and climb. The weapon is controlled purely by joysticks, creating a gameplay experience without button pressing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A face stylizer that puts an artistic mask generated from a portrait painting on the face in a photo. It detects facial keypoints in both the painting and the photo, warps the painting onto the photo according to the keypoints, and blends them with different weights on different areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
