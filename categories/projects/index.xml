      <description>An optimization of STARTS (STAtic Regression Test Selection) Maven plugin, which helps running only the impacted tests since last build. Reduced the time required to perform dependency analysis phase by 70% by running it concurrently with the test execution phase. Implemented the idea about offline mode in this paper at ASE 2017.
A semester-long project of CS 527 Advanced Topics in Software Engineering at UIUC.</description>

      <description>A 3D platform game where the hero climbs a four-sided tower while dogding and attacking enemies. His weapon can switch between a hammer and a propeller, helping him attack as well as jump and climb. The weapon is controlled purely by rotating a joystick of the Xbox controller, creating a gameplay experience without button pressing. Gameplay Video</description>

      <title>Artistic Face Stylizer</title>

      <description>A face stylizer that puts an artistic mask generated from a portrait painting on the face in a photo. It detects facial keypoints in both the painting and the photo, warps the painting onto the photo according to the keypoints, and blends them with different weights on different areas.
Inspired by this paper at SIGGRAPH 2017. Simplified the input from stream videos to static photos.
Collaborated with Yukang Shen as the final project of CS 543 Computer Vision at UIUC.</description>

      <description>A search engine back-end for recommanding skin care products on Amazon according to different effects and product types. It&amp;rsquo;s currently a little bit complicate to use. I plan to simplify the usage and hopefully deploy it, so that you could easily try it out. Collaborated with Shu Song and Siyu Bian as the final project of CS410 Text Information Systems at UIUC.</description>
