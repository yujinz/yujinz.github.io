My name is Yujin Zhang (pronounced You-jean Jaang). I'm a master student in CS at UIUC. I received my BS degrees in CS from University of Michigan and in ECE from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I'm interested in understanding how computer systems work, especially how they improve reliability and efficiency. I enjoy building applications that can benefit people around me, and hopefully bringing a little bit of happiness to their lives. Besides, I like visiting museums, reading fictions, and (watching other people) playing games.
