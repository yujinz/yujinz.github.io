My name is Yujin Zhang (pronounced You-jean Jaang). I'm a master student in CS at UIUC. I received my BS degrees in CS from University of Michigan and in ECE from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I'm interested in computer systems and full-stack web development, and I'm always excited to explore more.

Below are some of my projects and you can see my resume [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yujinz/yujinz.github.io/master/resume.pdf).
